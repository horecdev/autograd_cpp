DONE Toposort
DONE 10 Backward passes
DONE Rename to view and alloc
DONE ConcatNode + bwd pass
DONE Slicing with ranges
DONE Implement dependencies to every node.
DONE Wipe grad memory after its no longer needed (current passed its grads down) (toposort)
DONE Write zero_grad to tensor class
DONE InPlaceOpps as disguise to normal opps (no nodes, just operator overload)
DONE Delete nodes on Inplace
DONE test out the bwd pass.
DONE InPlace mutation on REALZIE TIME if refcount tensorstate == 1 and refcount storage == 1. Its guaranteed to be an rvalue living only inside AddNode. Add to ALL applicable
DONE Check if requires grad to do calculation inside node backward() function
DONE Remove m_version from existence
DONE Unary nodes (ReLU) + framework
DONE Refactor storage to be 32-bit aligned for AVX, and hold an ENUM CPU/CUDA
DONE Update Tensor, TensorState constructors to support eager size/device propagation
DONE Reflect changes inside lazy and eager operations to use the new constructors and pass correct parameters
DONE Add assertions that devices are identical
DONE Fix the fill / write inefficiency (1GB writes for 500MB tensor for stuff with alloc) for CPU
DONE apply_unary_in_place + make contiguous use it
DONE BIG REFACTOR (hide backend from frontend)
DONE Update the out of, in, reduce etc. to write to uninitialized memory. think of the issue where memory is initialized and scalars.
DONE Write 6 dispatchers (out of, in, reduce, unary in, unary out of, layout) - everything that copies/creates new data gets a dispatcher to cuda/cpu
DONE Split into lob_alloc and lob_view files the lobotomized funcs so you can include views inside cpu_apply (they dont need dispatchers)
DONE Fix #includes
DONE Compile this big ass codebase
DONE SIMD contiguous fast paths (apply_in_place, apply_out_of_place, apply_unary)
DONE Memory pools for CPU (same shape math ran thousands of times)
DONE Download CUDA toolkit and set up the compiler + cmake
DONE Write memory allocations for CUDA (CUDAMemPool)
DONE Extend Device to hold index and change enum CUDA/CPU to be DeviceType and apply for it (compile)
- Update CUDAMemPool to apply for multiple devices (mallocs too)
DONE Rename the repo on github to gradcraft
- Integrate CUDAMemPool into Storage class for allocations
- CUDA BRIDGE / UTILS .to() etc.
- CUDA KERNELS!
- DIM COALESCING
- Write alternative ctors for ones, zeros, normal, uniform etc.
- Link up BLAS and cuBLAS
- Write STACK node
- Add ton of bloated nodes so the engine is actually usable
